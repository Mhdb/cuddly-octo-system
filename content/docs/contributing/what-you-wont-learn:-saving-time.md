When you start a time management course you assume one thing.

You assume that you will learn tricks to save time with different techniques.

How to save an hour a day? 

How to save time by doing X or Y?

And so you will try to save time at the expense of other activities.

For example, you can watch TV shows replay to skip the commercials. 

This way can save you 15 minutes per hour, 30 minutes in two hours. 

Thirty minutes that you can use to do something else. 

But another way of saving 30 minutes to do other things would be not to watch TV for 2 hours.

That is not what you will learn to do in this lesson.

With this program, you will not learn how to save time.

No. 

It is not the purpose.

This course will show you things in a new light. 

This course will teach you to see differently.

**You don't live your life trying to save time.**

**You build the life you want first, so you never need to stall again.** 

In other words, the key to time management is managing your **priorities**.

Everything I do, the time I spend, is my choice. 

I don't do something _because_ it's not my priority.

Saying "I don't have time" means it's not my priority.

Time is a choice.

Dealing with time management issue is understanding what your priorities are in life.

When you focus on what matters you can build the life you want with the time you have.
