# To set goals you must first have self-confidence.

Lack of self-confidence is the first obstacle that prevents us from achieving our goals.

If we don't believe we can do something, then we won't give ourselves the means or the trouble to try.

For example, if we believe we can't learn to film and edit a video because we are bad at computers, then we won't give ourselves the motivation or the means to start.

Beliefs in our limitations are our limiting beliefs. They become obstacles in our lives.


To achieve our goals it is therefore essential to learn to recognise and neutralise our limiting beliefs.

# Becoming aware of your limiting beliefs

The first step to neutralizing limiting beliefs is to become aware of their existence.

Our beliefs are all rooted somewhere, they can come from our environment, from our teaching, from our personal experiences or from our confrontation with different stereotypes over time, and especially from our fears.

Our beliefs are assimilated by our brain in a similar way to our memories.

When faced with situations of stress or failure, our brain can integrate new limiting beliefs to prevent the situation from happening again.

This is why lack of motivation, anxiety and a feeling of fear will often arise at the thought of doing something that goes against what we believe.

And we fall into the trap!

## What are the limiting beliefs that prevent us from moving forward?

Limiting beliefs can be grouped into three categories: hopelessness (it won't make a difference), helplessness (I can't do it) and worthlessness (I don't deserve it).

## What are your limiting beliefs?

To find out what limiting beliefs are holding you back, ask yourself if any of these thoughts are familiar to you:

- I'm not good at this and it's never going to - change.
- It's never the same for me
- I'm too old / too young to do this
- I don't deserve to do it
- Even if I try, it won't make any difference
- I'm no good
- I have no chance
- I'll never make it

***Now try to make a list of your own limiting beliefs. Take a sheet of paper and a pen and list them.***
