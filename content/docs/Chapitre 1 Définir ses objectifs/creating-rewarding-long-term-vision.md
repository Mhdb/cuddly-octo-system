# Creating a rewarding vision

Creating a rewarding vision is an opportunity to help you imagine your life in the long term.

I recommend that you make it a fluid vision that is constantly evolving.

I also suggest making it exciting, motivating, energy-generating.

This is not the time to be too realistic.

A rewarding vision is a source of inspiration and motivation above all else.

The motivation created by a positive vision is powerful in many ways.

Your vision will help you choose goals that are true to your values.

Your vision will help you set short-term priorities and use it as a compass.

To help you create a rewarding vision I suggest you explore and materialise your research with a vision board

# How to create a vision board

To build a vision board you can use a large sheet of paper, a large cardboard box, a notebook, or a corkboard.
Ideally, you can hang it on the wall and place it in a visible place every day.
Then choose inspiring images that will illustrate your desires, goals and vision
Find images of what you want to learn, how you live, your relationships, what you want to create
You can find these elements in magazines or on the internet.
Let your intuition guide you, or search for what you want.
You can also draw elements.
Cut out and print your images and pin them on your board.
Collect inspirational words, create mantras that motivate you:
Find positive and inspiring affirmations to encourage you: "I get rich doing what I love", "My body my temple".
You can write your own affirmations or look for them in your favourite quotes, in a book, on the internet.
It's time to arrange your chart the way you want it! Add a picture of yourself, organise it by section, love, family, work, leisure, health, joy... you are free to use your imagination!

Your vision board, your life. You don't need to justify or explain your vision to others.

Believe in yourself, in your vision.

In the next lessons you will learn to create goals from your vision.
